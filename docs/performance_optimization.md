## Answer

### What is Vectorization in NumPy and How Does it Help in Performance Optimization?

Vectorization in NumPy refers to the practice of operating on entire arrays or matrices at once, rather than on individual elements sequentially. It leverages the underlying optimized C and Fortran implementations for array operations, leading to significantly improved computational efficiency and performance. By avoiding explicit looping constructs like `for` loops and utilizing efficient array operations, vectorization streamlines mathematical and logical operations on large datasets, making NumPy a powerful tool for high-performance computing.

Vectorization enables parallelization of operations, allowing them to be executed more efficiently on modern multi-core CPUs and GPUs.

# Create a large array
arr = np.random.rand(1000000)

# Timing using a Python loop
start_time = time.time()
squared_array = [x**2 for x in arr]
python_loop_time = time.time() - start_time

# Timing using a NumPy function (ufunc)
start_time = time.time()
squared_array_np = np.square(arr)
numpy_func_time = time.time() - start_time

print("Time taken by Python loop: {:.4f} seconds".format(python_loop_time))
print("Time taken by NumPy function: {:.4f} seconds".format(numpy_func_time))
```

In this example, you would observe a significant reduction in computation time when using the NumPy function (`np.square()`) compared to the Python loop, showcasing the performance improvement achieved by leveraging NumPy's optimized functions for element-wise operations.
