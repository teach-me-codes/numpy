1. **Mean Calculation**:
   - The mean (average) of an array can be calculated using `np.mean()` function in NumPy.
   - The formula to compute the mean of an array is:
     $$ \text{Mean} = \frac{1}{N} \sum_{i=1}^{N} x_i $$

   ```python
   import numpy as np
   
   # Create a NumPy array
   arr = np.array([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])
   
   # Calculate the mean
   mean_val = np.mean(arr)
   print("Mean:", mean_val)
   ```

2. **Median Calculation**:
   - The median of an array can be computed using `np.median()` function in NumPy.
   - Median is the middle value of a dataset when arranged in ascending order.
   
   ```python
   import numpy as np
   
   # Create a NumPy array
   arr = np.array([7, 3, 1, 4, 2, 6, 5])
   
   # Calculate the median
   median_val = np.median(arr)
   print("Median:", median_val)
   ```

3. **Standard Deviation Calculation**:
   - Standard deviation measures the spread of data around the mean.
   - NumPy provides `np.std()` function to compute the standard deviation of an array.
   - The formula for standard deviation is:
     $$ \text{Standard Deviation} = \sqrt{\frac{1}{N} \sum_{i=1}^{N} (x_i - \text{Mean})^2} $$

   ```python
   import numpy as np
   
   # Create a NumPy array
   arr = np.array([10, 12, 15, 18, 20])
   
   # Calculate the standard deviation
   std_dev = np.std(arr)
   print("Standard Deviation:", std_dev)
   ```
